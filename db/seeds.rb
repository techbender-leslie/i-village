An audacious 445-hp 4.4-liter turbo V-8 is optional and comes only with all-wheel drive. The standard Driving Dynamics Control system allows for five distinct driving modes and an available air suspension provides even more fine-tuning. Asking $64,000 OBO - email hipster@gmail.com. Currently being stored in climate controlled garage, but test drive can be arranged.',
